            <div class="container">
                <h2>Success Snapshots</h2>
                <p>At DigiYaan, success is measured by the tangible impact we create for our clients. Here are a few examples of how our custom AI solutions deliver real-world results:</p>
                
                <h3>1. Ayush Hospital: Revolutionizing Clinical Documentation</h3>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Ayush Hospital faced significant challenges with physician burnout and administrative overhead due to time-consuming clinical documentation. Doctors spent hours manually updating patient records, diverting attention from patient care.</p>
                <p><strong>Our AI:</strong> DigiYaan deployed a custom Ambient AI solution integrated directly into Ayush Hospital's existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) system. This platform passively listens to patient-physician conversations, intelligently extracts key medical information, and automatically generates comprehensive clinical notes.</p>
                <p><strong>Expected/Observed Outcome:</strong> Reduced clinical documentation time by <strong>60%</strong>, allowing physicians to dedicate more time to patient interaction and improving overall operational efficiency. The solution also enhanced data accuracy and completeness in patient records.</p>

                <h3>2. Global Manufacturing Co.: Optimizing Inventory for Peak Performance</h3>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> A large global manufacturing company struggled with unpredictable demand fluctuations and inefficient inventory management, leading to frequent stockouts of critical components and excessive holding costs for slow-moving items.</p>
                <p><strong>Our AI:</strong> DigiYaan developed a GenAI-powered Inventory Intelligence platform that integrated with their existing ERP system. The platform analyzes historical sales data, supplier lead times, market trends, and even external factors like weather patterns to provide highly accurate demand forecasts and optimized reorder points.</p>
                <p><strong>Expected/Observed Outcome:</strong> Achieved a <strong>20% reduction in inventory holding costs</strong> and a <strong>35% decrease in stockouts</strong> for key components. This led to improved production efficiency, reduced waste, and enhanced customer satisfaction due to consistent product availability.</p>

                <h3>3. Nexus Legal Group: Accelerating Contract Review</h3>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Nexus Legal Group, a prominent law firm, was overwhelmed by the volume and complexity of contracts requiring review for mergers and acquisitions. Manual review processes were slow, costly, and prone to missing critical clauses, posing significant risk to clients.</p>
                <p><strong>Our AI:</strong> DigiYaan implemented an AI Legal Advisor specifically trained on Nexus Legal Group's vast repository of legal documents and case precedents. This GenAI solution rapidly scans, analyzes, and summarizes contracts, identifying key terms, obligations, risks, and compliance issues with high precision.</p>
